box model
    inner most box is the content-box
    margin separates elements

static positioning: default-placement in browser, 
    aka placement without any styles added

position is static by default unless you change it

box-sizing: boarder-box; can be used to set the size of the entire box

in order to use position: absolute; you must put that div inside another div,
    this establishes a parent-child relationship
