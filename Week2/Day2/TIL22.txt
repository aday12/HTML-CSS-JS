you can use system-ui in css font family to tell font to fall back to whatever the
    user has as their default font

using an @import statement in css doc allows you to skip 
    the <link/> tag in your html doc, but makes the styles slower to come in

you absolutely must wrap bootstrap components in some sort of container class
    to be able to style them
