ctrl + c or .exit to exit node.js 

html = content, js = interactivity, css = styling of content that the user sees
    js can dynamically add css to html

comparing JS to Java
    Bigint is arbitrary
    you can have an undefined variable
    null is a deliberate choice you make
    object types: function, array, date, regex, error
    you can write numbers in several ways: binary, octal, decimal, or hex
    still has && || and !
    still have += etc
    + can still concact strings
    comments are // or /* */
    ===
    while and do... while loops still exist, do while is written differently
    for loop is the same
    for...of and for...in loops are new 
    still have switch cases, try/catch, and errors

Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety.
    Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into 
    an object reference or access private memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. 
    Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and 
    their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly
    coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex
    than JavaScript programming.
    js = runtime

click red dot on left to set breakpoint in vs code, you can also type "debugger;" to set a breakpoint
