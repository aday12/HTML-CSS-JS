fetch command yields a promise
    promise is an object

event loop

synchronous code is evaluated step by step

async code runs it all simultaneously 
    you cant have multiple threads but you can do some things at a later time

a promise is something that will be a value that is determined later    
    use a promise ctor to create a promise object 
        which is mostly used to wrap callback-based API
    an executor is a function to be executed by promise ctor
    
make sure you understand when you have access to which data 
    during the fetch process
